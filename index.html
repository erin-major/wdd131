                <p>Utah is a landlocked state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. Of the fifty U.S. states, Utah is the 13th-largest by area; with a population over three million, it is the 30th-most-populous and 11th-least-densely populated. Utah has been inhabited for thousands of years by various indigenous groups such as the ancient Puebloans, Navajo, and Ute. People from Utah are known as Utahns.</p>
